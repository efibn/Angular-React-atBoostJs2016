#Angular-React at Boost(js) 2016#

	Talk about how combine and work with Angular and React in the same application and enjoy from the goodies of both frameworks
	
	In order to make the samples work
	
This is just a little sandbox for me to play with React + Angular together.

To run the demo:

```
cd angular_react_directive_example
npm install
npm run dev
Browse to http://localhost:8080
```
